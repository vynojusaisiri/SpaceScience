Artificial intelligence means decision making and solving the complex problems with increased accuracy and performing high level computations. It is a simulation of human intelligence done by machines.

Deep learning and Machine Learning are the two ways to implement AI.

Space Science it encompasses scientific discipline that involves space exploration and steady natural phenomena physical bodies occur in outer space such as space medicine and Astro biology how do I actually shaved space signs so far space science in the sense it means the infinite reality 
                                                                  so I think the AI is the key to find out the answers so let's go to the space exploration no newly discovered Kepler 98 that orbits a star is one of the fields achieved by AI the planet was actually discovered through NASA's Kepler Space Telescope by using ML basically that's a lot of data.
    
And they were able to put a malcomson neural network to get the results that they may not have possible few decades ago space agencies only crossed global how realize the important and prevalence of AI in space exploration and we are seeing the results right now.....
